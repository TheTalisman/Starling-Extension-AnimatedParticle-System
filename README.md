Starling Extension: Animated Particle System
===================================

This Starling Extension allows you to create PD (Particle Designer) particle systems using animations from Sprite Sheets by passing a Starling TextureAtlas instance to the particle system constructor.

This extension depends on the Starling Framework: https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Framework and the Starling-Extension-Particle-System: https://github.com/PrimaryFeather/Starling-Extension-Particle-System

Sample Code
-----------

The example directory contains a quick demonstration for creating a particle system of 500 animated birds. All artwork in the example belongs to Gamua/PrimaryFeather.

More information
----------------

Particle configurations can be created with the 71 Squared Particle Designer or the online Particle Editor. For more info, see:
